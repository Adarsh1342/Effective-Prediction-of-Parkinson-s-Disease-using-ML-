# Problem Statement
The problem of accurately and early predicting Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains a challenge, as traditional clinical assessments may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle markers of PD at an early stage. Existing prediction methods lack the precision, scalability, and interpretability needed for widespread clinical implementation. Therefore, there is a need to develop robust and interpretable machine learning (ML) models that can leverage diverse datasets to accurately predict PD, enabling early intervention strategies and improving patient outcomes.
