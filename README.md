# Problem Statement
The problem of accurately and early predicting Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains a challenge, as traditional clinical assessments may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle markers of PD at an early stage. Existing prediction methods lack the precision, scalability, and interpretability needed for widespread clinical implementation. Therefore, there is a need to develop robust and interpretable machine learning (ML) models that can leverage diverse datasets to accurately predict PD, enabling early intervention strategies and improving patient outcomes.

# Objective
The objective is to comprehensively review and analyze the current state-of-the-art in the development of machine learning (ML) models for prediction of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and provide an enhanced model for prediction of PD. This includes exploring various ML techniques, data types, and challenges associated with PD prediction.

The project aims to provide insights into the strengths, limitations, and future directions of ML-based PD prediction, and highlight opportunities for improving accuracy, interpretability, and clinical implementation of ML models for PD prediction.
